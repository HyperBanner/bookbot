# bookbot

BookBot is my first [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) project!

# WOW

This was a decently challenging project, but it was really fun to do! I think I already learned tonnes by just doing this one simple project.
I'm eagerly awaiting what the course will throw at me next!
Huge thanks to boot.dev for making this guided project course.

# About

This is a bookbot (CLI tool) that you can use on utf-8 encoded text files to print out some basic things about the file (currently word count and counts for each character).
